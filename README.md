# FolderStructureMaker

This project is an Angular application that creates a folder structure by adding nodes at root, parent and child level.
It can be represented as a JSON file that specifies the names of the folders and files created and their parent-child relationships.

Delete functionality at child nodes level is yet to be implemented.
